## Description
WhatFlower is a project that uses Machine Learning to determine what type of flower is it in the photo taken and displaying wikipedia's image and information. Unfortunately, the ML model, used in this project, is not that great at recognizing the flowers. Using a better ML model will result in a better pinpoint accuracy of figuring out the flower.
